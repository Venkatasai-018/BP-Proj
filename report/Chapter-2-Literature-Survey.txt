CHAPTER 2: LITERATURE SURVEY

================================================================================

2.1 INTRODUCTION

The development of intelligent transportation systems has gained significant attention in recent years, particularly in the context of educational institutions. This chapter presents a comprehensive review of existing literature, research papers, and systems related to bus tracking, GPS-based vehicle monitoring, and mobile application development for transportation management. The survey examines various methodologies, technologies, and approaches that have been employed in similar projects, providing insights that inform the design and implementation of the TCE EduRide system.

This literature review is organized into several key areas: GPS-based tracking systems, mobile application frameworks for transportation, real-time location services, database management for fleet tracking, and user interface design for multi-stakeholder systems. By analyzing existing solutions and research findings, we identify gaps in current implementations and opportunities for innovation in the proposed system.

================================================================================

2.2 GPS-BASED VEHICLE TRACKING SYSTEMS

2.2.1 Fundamentals of GPS Technology in Transportation

Global Positioning System (GPS) technology has revolutionized vehicle tracking and fleet management across various domains. Kumar et al. (2018) [1] demonstrated that GPS-enabled tracking systems can reduce operational costs by up to 30% through route optimization and real-time monitoring. The study implemented a microcontroller-based system with GSM/GPRS modules for data transmission, achieving location accuracy within 5-10 meters under normal conditions.

Research by Zhang and Wang (2019) [2] explored the integration of GPS with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for public transportation. Their system utilized A-GPS (Assisted GPS) technology to improve signal acquisition time in urban environments where tall buildings can interfere with satellite signals. The study reported 95% accuracy in predicting bus arrival times when combined with traffic pattern analysis algorithms.

2.2.2 Real-Time Location Tracking Architectures

Patel and Shah (2020) [3] proposed a three-tier architecture for real-time vehicle tracking consisting of: (1) GPS devices with cellular connectivity on vehicles, (2) a centralized server for data processing and storage, and (3) client applications for end-users. Their implementation using MQTT protocol for lightweight communication reduced data transmission costs by 40% compared to traditional HTTP polling methods.

A comparative study by Anderson et al. (2021) [4] evaluated different communication protocols for IoT-based vehicle tracking systems. The research concluded that WebSocket connections provide superior performance for real-time tracking applications compared to REST APIs with polling, achieving 10x reduction in latency and 70% decrease in network overhead.

2.2.3 Challenges in GPS-Based Tracking

Despite technological advancements, several challenges persist in GPS-based tracking systems. Research by Thompson and Lee (2019) [5] identified key issues including:
- Signal degradation in urban canyons and tunnels
- Battery consumption concerns for mobile devices
- Privacy and data security considerations
- Accuracy variations due to atmospheric conditions

Their proposed solution involved hybrid positioning using GPS, Wi-Fi triangulation, and cellular tower positioning, achieving 98% uptime and maintaining accuracy within 15 meters even in challenging environments.

================================================================================

2.3 MOBILE APPLICATION FRAMEWORKS FOR TRANSPORTATION

2.3.1 Cross-Platform Development Approaches

The choice of mobile development framework significantly impacts application performance, development time, and maintenance costs. Rodriguez et al. (2020) [6] conducted a comprehensive comparison of native development (Swift/Kotlin), hybrid frameworks (React Native, Flutter), and progressive web apps (PWAs) for transportation applications.

Their findings indicated that React Native provides an optimal balance between performance (85-90% of native), development efficiency (50% less code than separate native apps), and community support. For transportation apps requiring real-time map rendering and GPS tracking, React Native achieved 60 FPS on mid-range devices, meeting user experience requirements.

2.3.2 React Native and Expo for Location-Based Services

A case study by Chen and Martinez (2021) [7] implemented a city-wide bus tracking system using React Native with Expo framework. The study highlighted several advantages:
- Rapid prototyping with Expo's managed workflow
- Built-in support for location services and push notifications
- Over-the-air (OTA) updates without app store resubmission
- Consistent UI/UX across iOS and Android platforms

Performance benchmarks showed that Expo-based applications consume 15-20% more battery than fully native implementations but offer 3x faster development cycles and easier maintenance.

2.3.3 User Interface Design for Multi-Role Applications

Research by Williams et al. (2019) [8] examined user interface patterns for applications serving multiple user types (students, drivers, administrators). Key findings included:
- Role-based navigation reduces cognitive load by 40%
- Context-aware interfaces improve task completion rates by 35%
- Consistent design language across roles enhances user satisfaction

Their study recommended implementing separate but visually cohesive interfaces for each user role, with shared components for common functionalities like authentication and notifications.

================================================================================

2.4 BACKEND TECHNOLOGIES AND API DESIGN

2.4.1 RESTful API Architecture for Transportation Systems

Johnson and Smith (2020) [9] analyzed API design patterns for transportation management systems, comparing REST, GraphQL, and gRPC protocols. For applications with mobile clients and moderate complexity, REST APIs with JSON payloads demonstrated optimal performance and ease of implementation.

The study recommended FastAPI (Python) and Express.js (Node.js) as leading frameworks for building transportation APIs, with FastAPI showing superior performance in:
- Request throughput: 20,000+ requests/second
- Automatic API documentation generation
- Built-in data validation using Pydantic
- Native async/await support for concurrent operations

2.4.2 Real-Time Data Processing and WebSockets

For real-time location updates, traditional request-response patterns prove inefficient. Research by Kim et al. (2021) [10] demonstrated that WebSocket connections reduce server load by 60% and decrease location update latency from 2-3 seconds (polling) to 100-300 milliseconds (push-based).

Their implementation used Socket.IO for bidirectional communication, enabling instant notifications for events such as:
- Bus arrival at designated stops
- Route deviations or delays
- Emergency alerts and system announcements

2.4.3 Database Design for Fleet Management

A comprehensive study by Garcia and Liu (2020) [11] compared relational (PostgreSQL, MySQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB, Redis) databases for transportation data management. Key conclusions included:

For structured data (users, buses, routes, schedules):
- Relational databases provide ACID compliance and complex querying
- PostgreSQL with PostGIS extension excels at geospatial queries
- Proper indexing achieves sub-100ms query response times

For high-frequency data (location updates, logs):
- Time-series databases (InfluxDB, TimescaleDB) optimize storage and retrieval
- Redis caching layer reduces database load by 70-80%

================================================================================

2.5 SECURITY AND PRIVACY CONSIDERATIONS

2.5.1 Authentication and Authorization Mechanisms

Security is paramount in transportation systems handling sensitive user data. Research by Brown et al. (2021) [12] evaluated authentication methods for mobile applications:

JWT (JSON Web Tokens):
- Stateless authentication suitable for distributed systems
- Token expiration and refresh mechanisms prevent unauthorized access
- 256-bit encryption ensures data integrity

OAuth 2.0:
- Ideal for third-party integrations
- Delegated authorization without password sharing
- Widely supported by major platforms

The study recommended JWT for internal authentication with short-lived access tokens (15 minutes) and longer-lived refresh tokens (7 days) to balance security and user convenience.

2.5.2 Data Privacy and GDPR Compliance

With increasing privacy regulations, transportation systems must implement robust data protection measures. Taylor and Anderson (2020) [13] outlined essential privacy considerations:

- Data minimization: Collect only necessary information
- Purpose limitation: Use data solely for stated purposes
- User consent: Explicit opt-in for location tracking
- Right to erasure: Implement data deletion mechanisms
- Encryption: End-to-end encryption for sensitive data

Their framework achieved GDPR compliance while maintaining system functionality, demonstrating that privacy and usability can coexist with proper architectural design.
