CHAPTER 7: RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

================================================================================

7.1 INTRODUCTION

This chapter presents the results obtained from the development, testing, and evaluation of the TCE EduRide Bus Tracking System. It provides a comprehensive analysis of the system's performance, functionality, and effectiveness in meeting the specified requirements and objectives. The chapter includes screenshots of the implemented system, performance metrics, user feedback, comparative analysis with existing solutions, and discussion of the project's achievements and limitations.

The results are organized into several key areas: system functionality demonstration through screenshots and descriptions, performance evaluation metrics including response times and resource utilization, user acceptance testing results and feedback, security assessment outcomes, scalability testing results, and comparative analysis with traditional bus management systems. Each section presents both quantitative data and qualitative observations.

The discussion section interprets these results in the context of the project objectives outlined in Chapter 1, analyzes how well the system addresses the identified problems in existing systems, evaluates the effectiveness of the chosen technologies and algorithms, and identifies areas for future enhancement. This chapter provides evidence that the TCE EduRide system successfully achieves its goals of improving bus tracking, enhancing operational efficiency, and delivering a user-friendly experience for students, drivers, and administrators.
